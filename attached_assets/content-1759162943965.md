Pets 2.0

Forget everything you thought you knew about pets in Dank Memer! Because this is such a major change, we’ve added new tutorials to explain the changes:

- [Pet basics](https://dankmemer.lol/tutorials/pet-basics)
- [Pet training and skills](https://dankmemer.lol/tutorials/pet-training-and-skills)
- [Pet rooms and stasis](https://dankmemer.lol/tutorials/pet-rooms-and-stasis)

New Commands

/pets rooms

- Each room contains up to a maximum of:
  - 5 pets
  - 4 floor decorations
  - 6 wall decorations or windows or doors
- Floor and wall style is customizable
- Rooms can be named/renamed
- Everyone starts with 1 room
- Up to 10 rooms total can be purchased
- Anyone who bought pet slots will have slots transferred into rooms. If you had 50 pet slots, you’ll start with 10 rooms, for example.
- Cosmetics are sometimes paid and sometimes found in various places
  - There will be a place to see this added in a future update, for now you can refer to [this image](https://imagedelivery.net/BLWzKjZx6tWuG7fpo67USA/a03a51b0-1b4f-4b22-f30d-c28b731fd800/public)

/pets stasis

- Contains any pets you receive when all rooms are full or when buying on the market or getting from friends
- Pets in stasis have all their stats frozen, and cannot be interacted with at all
- Pets can be removed from stasis when you have space for them in a room
  - Removing pets and putting them in a room results in a 6 hour thawing process

/pets activity

- Shows a history of what your pets have been doing
  - Almost like `/currencylog` but for your pets!

/pets sitter

- Allows you to hire pet sitters to take care of pets automatically
- Sitter: Winston

- Sitter: Tatiana
  - Description: Pets will not fight, have an increased chance of breeding, but won’t fetch.
- Sitter: Martha (Premium Only)
  - Description: Slightly increases pet activity in the room, such as breeding. Less so than other sitters. No downside though.

Pets Dashboard

Sharing Pets

- When sharing pets via the market or via friends, there are some debuffs to prevent animal abuse
  - Pets will sleep for 3 days after being shared

Pet Hunting

- This feature now takes an hour rather than being instant.
  - Imagine you are now sending your pet out to actually go hunt! Check back in an hour later using the `/pets activity` command to see what you got
- Some rarer pets got unique loot tables for hunting at hunt level 10:
  - Spaget monster, Yeti, Jack frost, blobfish, gnome

Minigames

- Pet minigames are now fully unique to pets!
- While they might seem hard at first, the phrases and words are unique to specific pets so you’ll learn your pet type’s stuff quickly after some adjustment!

  - and more!

Misc

- Vacation
  - No longer refills pet bars, sitters can be used instead
  - This was a bug which was never intended this way. Vacation was only supposed to prevent pets from losing level/running away and not keep their stats full.
- Stream now has a better chat view!
